- 🌱 I’m currently learning about distributed computing, system design, and financial mathematics!
- 🤔 If I'm not at school/work, you'll find me perfecting my coffee 👨‍🔬☕, or in the heart of Toronto doing some street photography 📷🏙.
- 📚 Currently Reading:
  - _The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn_, by Richard W. Hamming.
  - _Mathematics for Finance_, by Marek Capinski.
